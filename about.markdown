Within canonical Buddhist teachings, the division of nama and rupa—or
name and form—is presented as a particularly fundamental division. Unlike the
common meaning of the word, name here refers to the formless qualities that
are connected with the experience of a form: thoughts, feeling, perceptions, and
awareness. Viewed this way, existence can be viewed as oppositions, harmonies,
and other interplays between name and form, and art-making as the conscious
manipulation of them. My practice—both contemplative and artistic—is an
investigation of this division and the effect that nama processes have on media.

This can be understood from a (perhaps tortured) semiotic perspective if all
form or material is understood to be a signifier for whatever mental and
emotional processes occur in conjunction with it, forming a tautological sign. Thus,
even a “meaningless” form can be seen as an affirmation of its own existence,
its history, and its connotations. My artwork is then a product of and reflection
on this perspective.

Although not constrained by a particular medium or method, recent work often
appropriates violent or otherwise provocative digital video and photography,
as they provide fertile ground for explorations of this kind due to their easily
transformable nature as digital objects. Additionally, the use of photographic
media creates a conversation with other similar semiotic-like explorations of
the space, such as Roland Barthes’ <em>Camera Lucida</em> Viewed abstractly as a
collection of color values (rupa) and its evocations (nama) the digital image’s
meaning may be manipulated by the nondestructive restructuring of the data
themselves by shifting them, as is often the case in my recent work, temporally.
Like the water in a glass when disturbed becomes redistributed while remaining
complete, the elements of the video or image remain the same, being simply
redistributed. This reordering of pixel data within an image or video prompts
the re-perception of the original form, calling into question the means by which
we create and maintain meaning.
